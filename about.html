    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      We created this tool as a learning project to dive deeper into the inner workings of algorithms like heaps and Huffman's algorithm. While the final product is intentionally simple, the process behind it helped us better understand the structure and efficiency behind file compression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was not just academic — we also wanted to build something functional that could be used universally by anyone, regardless of device or technical background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, mobile users often rely on third-party apps to compress files. Our website offers an easier alternative — a lightweight, browser-based solution that doesn’t require downloads or installations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're on a computer, tablet, or phone, we aim to make file compression as seamless and accessible as possible.
