    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p class="about-text">
      We made this as a project for practice to understand the deeper workings of things like heaps and Huffman's algorithm. 
      The project itself is simple and meant to be universally used as well.

    <p class="about-text">
      As it currently stands, for the sake of things like mobile phones, the easiest way for users to compress a file is through third-party software. 
      This is where our website comes in â€” offering a lightweight, browser-based solution that doesn't require installation or technical experience.
